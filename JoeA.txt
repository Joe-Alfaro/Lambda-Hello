NEW CHANGES My name is Joe Alfaro, I'm from Brentwood, California. I was a mechanic for 8 years, and I like to do woodworking for a hobby. I build furniture, small projects, and I really like to build my own tools. Tools themselves have become a kind of hobby for me too, buying old rusty tools and restoring them, and building my own woodworking machines. I also am a dad, I have two little girls who are adopted and a baby boy who is my foster son.
